## Spouter Inn

The Spouter Inn is the only landmark mentioned in this passage that is not on Nantucket. It is in the semi-adjacent whaling town of New Bedford, MA. While lodging at the Spouter Inn, the innkeeper Peter Coffin tells "Ishmael" to see out his cousin, Hosea Hussey, when seeking lodging on Nantucket. It is the misunderstanding of Peter Coffin's directions that cause the navigational confusion in the excerpt provided on the left side of the screen.
