## Try Pots

Try Pots is "Ishmael" and Queequeg's destination. Here is where "Ishamel" first tastes New England clam chowder and gives the reader a very detailed description of the delicacy. As the Try Pots is a fictional location, this project attempted to choose an appropriate destination. As Hosea Hussey was the proprietor of the inn, it seemed to make the most sense to pin the Try Pots at the modern-day Hussey Street Guest House -- a hotel likely leveraging the literary significance of the Hussey name. However, the location of that hotel was on Broad street and would be a straight shot from the anchoring location. This would not result in a believable confusion by the travelers.

Surprisingly, after mapping out the possible ways the travelers could have gone, there is a perfectly located Hussey Street in modern Nantucket that breaks off of Center Street. Center Street was a perfect location for the "starboard corner," so it made perfect sense to place the fictional Try Pots Inn on the street bearing the name of its proprietor.
