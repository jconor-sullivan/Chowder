## Anchor

As Melville did not provide exact coordinates for where the ship was anchored, we are using this estimated spot for where ships might anchor. For the sake of this project, we are presupposing that the ship is achored with the stern facing the shore. This means the starboard side of the island will be due east, and the larboard side of the island will be due west. This anchor positioning informs the estimated positioning of all the other landmarks on the island.
