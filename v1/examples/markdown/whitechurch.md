## White Church

The white church is the next landmark the travelers seek out after reaching the yellow warehouse. According to the passage, once "Ishmael"'s route maintains the yellow warehouse on his starboard hand, he will be forced away from Broad Street and never successfully reach the white church. Thus, he will never be able to successfully take a left at the starboard corner. 

This project shows a polyline on "Ishmael's Route" that keeps the warehouse to his left while still trying to follow a semblance of a path on the modern Nantucket street grid. For the sake of appropriateness, we have Ishmael's route end at a modern day church situated many blocks away from the fictionalized location of the Try Pots Inn.
