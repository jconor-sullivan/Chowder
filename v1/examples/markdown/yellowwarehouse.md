## Yellow Warehouse

The yellow warehouse is the crux of the confusion between the two travelers. "Ishmael" believes that Peter Coffin told them to keep the church on the starboard hand, while Queequeg believed him to say the larboard hand. 

Using the buttons underneath the passage to the left, you can see visualization's of each traveler's path. Ishamel diverges at the church and keeps it on his left side -- getting lost and eventually ending up at a modern day church on a dead end. 

Queequeg correctly keeps the church to his right side, and effectively follows the remaining directions to the Try Pots Inn.
